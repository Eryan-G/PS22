<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Here is where you give a brief (one paragraph overview of your entire paper). This should include some background/introduction, some methodology, results and conclusions.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Nowadays, the global economy is experiencing a huge recession due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, there is growing concern about the impact of the global economic downturn on mental health. Some studies have shown that lower income is related to mental disorders, while this association has not been found in other studies. To study the relationship between income and mental health, we will build an analysis of the data from the 2017 General Social Survey (GSS) on the Family, which is conducted by stratified sampling. By drawing the bar plot, we can find out if there is any relationship between income and mental health. After that, we can be able to build a linear regression model for these two variables to further examine the association between income and mental health.</p>

<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data selected are number of people in different income ranges, and their mental health condition. In particular, we select people who rate their mental health “excellent” in different income groups. Since these two groups of data are well-organized, and it’s very direct to see the relationship between income and mental health condition. However, one potential drawback is that we only collect data of people who rate themselves “Excellent” and ignore other conditions. It might cause confunsion that whether there is more people of high income ranges rate their mental health conditions “Excellent” or “Poor”. Another drawback is that there might be other factors that influence one’s mental health condition other than income like educational level or living environment. However, we can’t identify this problem at this point.</p>
<p>The questionnaire provides information of social trends of a typical Canadian family. Throughout analyzing and intrepretating the responses from the survey, we can monitor the social behaviors of Canadians over time and solve social and political issues. The bad about the survey is that people might reveal their private information like income, household size.</p>
<p>The target population is all persons who are 15 years old or older in Canada except for the residents of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut and full-time residents of institutions. Frames are lists of telephone numbers in use provided by various sources and also the address registered. Sampled population are people within each telephone and address in each stratum.The method used is stratified sampling.</p>
<p>Firstly, each of ten provinces were divided into strata. Then, simple random sampling without replacement is applied to each strata to form a test group. The advantage of stratified sampling is that it provides a more accurate dataset that can represent the whole population since the entire population is stratified first. However, the bad side about stratified sampling is that it can’t apply to all kinds of study. When survey planner can’t classify the stratum properly, the method cannot be used. The response rate for the 2017 GSS was 52.4%. The researchers wanted to improve the non-response rate by adjusting the proportion of “cell phone only” households into the frame. The cost for the survey is not much since it only delivered by telephone numbers and address. It save the cost of travel expense.</p>
